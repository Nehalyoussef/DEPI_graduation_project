# Bikes Store Sales Analysis Performance
This project was part of my DEPI graduation program, where I applied data analytics techniques to analyze the performance of a bike store's sales. The goal was to uncover insights, identify patterns, and make data-driven recommendations to enhance business decision-making.

## 📊 Project Objective
To analyze the bike store's sales data and provide actionable insights on:
* Customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
* Sales trends over time (seasonality, peak periods, etc.).
* Product performance and revenue contribution.
* Key factors influencing sales performance.
  
## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
* Python and R: Both were used for data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory analysis, with similar workflows implemented in each.
* Tableau: For creating visualizations and presenting insights.
  
## 📈 Key Questions Answered
* Which cities and states contributed the highest revenue for the bike store?
* What were the most popular bike models, and how did their sales vary across different years?
* Who were the key customers driving the highest revenue in each year?
* Which sales representatives performed best, and how did they impact overall revenue?
* During which seasons or months did sales peak, and how did sales trends evolve over time?
  
## 🚀 How It Works
Data Cleaning:
* Verified the dataset had no missing values or duplicates.
* Standardized order dates into a consistent format.
* Mapped state abbreviations to their full names for better clarity.
* Renamed the column sales_rep to sales_representative.
* Converted numeric month values (1-12) to month names (January-December).
  
Exploratory Data Analysis:
* Conducted an in-depth analysis of sales patterns and trends using Python and R.

Visualization:
* Created insightful visualizations using Tableau to highlight key findings and recommendations.

## 📊 Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. Key revenue drivers were identified, including top-performing cities, states, products, and sales representatives. Seasonal trends and peak periods were highlighted, offering actionable recommendations to optimize marketing strategies, inventory management, and sales performance for future growth.
